If you have Godaddy .crt, .pem, and .p7b files, do the following to get necessary x509 certificate for hosting.openssl pkcs12 can't read password
Follow Godaddy's instructions for completing the certificate signing request. This will mean importing the intermediates, and
running the complete certificate signing request process in IIS. 
Then export a pfx (PKCS12) from IIS.
Run the following commands to create the necesesary cert file.
Extract the private key: 
openssl pkcs12 -in certname.pfx -nocerts -out key.pem -nodes

Extract the certificate: 
openssl pkcs12 -in certname.pfx -nokeys -out cert.cer

Extract the certs from the intermediate .p7b file: 
openssl pkcs7 -print_certs -in certificate.p7b -out intermediates.cer

Combine the files into a single cert file: 
openssl pkcs12 -export -out domain.pfx -inkey key.pem -in cert.cer -in intermediates.cer

I wasn't actually able to get this to work though. What I had to do was export the cert with private key from the server it was installed on,
then use MMC, add the license snap in for local machine, import the intermediate cert, import the PFX into personal store, then the software
can retrieve the cert from X509Store, instead of using the X509Certificate.CreateFromCertFile() constructor and loading a file.

If you get the error "The credentials supplied to the package were not recognized" Then open MMC, add Certificate, local machine, find the cert,
right click and choose Manage private keys. Make sure the user account the system is running as has access (or Everyone, if you are brave enough).
